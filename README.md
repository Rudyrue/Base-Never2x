# Never2x (Raw Gameplay)
This is meant to serve as a repository to understand Never2x's gameplay loop easier,  
and also for people wanting to copy the gameplay loop for their own engines/mods.

It has pretty much nothing except a basic options menu for mandatory settings,  
and nothing else.

Gameplay is in `funkin.objects.PlayField` and `funkin.backend.Conductor`.  
  


ok but seriously use the code for whatever i don't give a shit lol
